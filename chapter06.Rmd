# How threads work

Tweet threads are one of the little gems of this microblogging platform. A thread is just a string of tweets all linked together by the author and will relate to a topic in some way. Here's how a thread shows up in you feed. 

When composing a thread, usually people indicate this by starting it with [Thread] or 1/n or some other way to highlight it's a thread.

People can reply to any of the tweets in a thread which starts a mini offshoot thread. This can become a bit confusing if you want to see all replies to a thread, and we bascically have to live with it until Twitter finds a way to make this more intuitive.
