# Your first tweets
Enough of the tour, let's get you tweeting! 

Select the compose tweet button and start typing - note you cant edit a tweet once it's posted. Don't worry, everyone has forgiven spellign msiatkes in tweets long ago :).

Say anythign you want, or if you're stuck for inspiration say "Yay! My first tweet!", or the ever famous, "Hello, world!". 

Now try another tweet, thsi time tagging people. Say something like "Hey @verlee @oscarb I'm trying this twitter thing out." We'll both get notifications of your tweet, and are eagerly waiting for it ;).  


Now try use a hashtag. 

"Wow #rstats is awesome!" Now people browsing this hashtag are more liekly to see your tweet. 

You'll get the hang of this in no-time.

We'll dissect some tweets later, but you get the idea.

Just a little tip, limit the use of hashtags to 3 or less in a tweet to keep it legible.
