# Your first tweets
Ok ready?

Try something or just say yay my first tweet!

Now try another, say something like hey @oscarb I'm trying this twitter thing out. 

I'll get a notification that I've been mentioned. 



Now try use a hashtag. 

'Wow #rstats is awesome!" Now people browsing this hashtag will see it more easily. 

You'll get the hang of this in no-time.

We'll dissect some tweets later
