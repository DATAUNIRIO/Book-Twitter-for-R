# Follow some more folks

The key to making Twitter work for you is to follow accounts that you find interesting. 
Accounts can be owned either by individuals or admistered by companies. 

Twitter will often recommend accounts for you to follow. 
Some may be relevant, so go ahead and follow them. 
Over time, you'll find that you follow more and more people. 

## Following people and organisations

You can find people to follow by searching for their Twitter handle. 
This is a unique identifier associated with each account.

We've listed a few accounts for you to follow and get some practice at the same time. 
These are some prominent members of the R community and they post good stuff. 
Go ahead and search for these accounts and follow them. Let's walk you through the first one. 

Search for Hadley Wickham by typing **[\@hadleywickham](https://twitter.com/hadleywickham){target="_blank"}** in the search bar. 
Hadley's profile will come up and you can select the **follow** button.

Well done! 
You've followed your first person :).

Now go ahead and follow a few other people:

* Mara Averick: **[\@dataandme](https://twitter.com/dataandme){target="_blank"}**
* Caitlin Hudon: **[\@beeonaposy](https://twitter.com/beeonaposy){target="_blank"}**
* Thomas Mock: **[\@thomas_mock](https://twitter.com/thomas_mock){target="_blank"}**
* Gina Reynolds: **[\@EvaMaeRey](https://twitter.com/EvaMaeRey){target="_blank"}**


There are also great organisational accounts:

* R4DS online learning community: **[\@R4DScommunity](https://twitter.com/R4DScommunity){target="_blank"}**
* R-Ladies Global: **[\@RLadiesGlobal](https://twitter.com/RLadiesGlobal){target="_blank"}**


If you're like me, you may start remembering people by their Twitter handle rather than their actual name!

Oh yes, you can also go ahead and follow me if you want :). 

Oscar Baruffa: **@oscar_b123**


Now that you're following people your feed will be populated by what they *post*, what they *like* and *re-tweet*.
We'll dive a little deeper into how the feed works a little later.  

But first: 

### A note on your own follower count


I can't stress this enough. 
> Ignore your own follower count. 
It's a great boost to ego as your follower number grows, but the benefit you get comes from following other accounts. 
You may get some followers yourself but that has no bearing on how much value you'll get from using Twitter.

## How to unfollow people

When you first signed up to Twitter, you were prompted to *follow* some popular accounts and you can now practice *unfollowing* on these.

First let's go back to those accounts you followed earlier. Your accounts will be different from these but the steps remain the same. 

<show unfollow steps, select profile, select followed accoutns, unfollwo uccoonuts>>

You can also *unfollow* directly from your feed lithis this.

<show unfollow steps from feed>


Well done! You're already getting the hang of this. Let's have a closer look at how your Twitter feed works.
