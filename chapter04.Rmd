# #Hashtags, what are they good for?

Quite a lot, actually. By now hashtags have found their way across multiple social media platforms. 

Selecting any hashtag you see will take you to a list of tweets that feature that tag.

Some important ones for your R journey are:


## #RStats
As a hashtag consisting of just one letter (#R) didn't quite cut it, the hashtag that was settled on was [#rstats](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstats){target="_blank"}. It is probably the most widely used hashtag by the R twitter community. 
The hashtag was first used in 2009. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">RT <a href="https://twitter.com/chrisalbon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ChrisAlbon</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/drewconway?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@drewconway</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#rstats</a> is the official R statistical language hashtag. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#rstats</a> (because <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/R?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#R</a> doesn&#39;t cut it)</p>&mdash; Michael E.

## Event hashtags

One of the best aspects of Twitter is following news about events and conferences. Of of the most popular is RstudioConf. The hashtag [#rstudioconf](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstudioconf){target="_blank"} becomes really active leading up to and during the event. If you're not attending the conference, following this hashtag gives you an idea of the what's going on during the conference. Tweets often contain take home messages of talks, screenshots, or links to slides. People attending the conference often use Twitter to meet up for coffee, or to get info on sessions that are cancelled.

Other event hashtags:

- #useR + year, eg. #useR2020
- #eRum + year, eg. #eRum2020
- #SatRday
