By now hashtags have found their way across multiple social media platforms. Selecting any hashtag you see will take you to a list of tweets that feature that tag. Some important ones for your R journey are: 4.1 #RStats As a hashtag consisting of just one letter (#R) didn‚Äôt quite cut it, the hashtag that was settled on was #rstats. It is probably the most widely used hashtag by the R Twitter community. The hashtag was first used in 2009. RT @ChrisAlbon @drewconway #rstats is the official R statistical language hashtag. #rstats (because #R doesn't cut it) ‚Äî Michael E. Driscoll (@medriscoll) April 3, 2009 I declare #rstats the official R statistical prog lang hashtag, pass it on to friends, family and Stata users ‚Äî Drew Conway (@drewconway) April 3, 2009 The @rstatstweet account retweets any tweets that contain the #rstats hashtag. The good thing about this is that your tweet will get more exposure. A possible downside from following the @rstatstweet account is that you might get overwhelmed by the huge amount of tweets that use this hashtag. 4.2 #TidyTuesday Every week there is a Tidy Tuesday challenge posted. It‚Äôs a dataset that everyone makes visualisations about and shares their results (and often source code too!). This is a fun way to improve your own skills by learning how others do things and practicing on interesting datasets. Read more about Tidy Tuesday on their Github page. The @R4DScommunity welcomes you to week 7 of #TidyTuesday!

Of of the most popular is RstudioConf. The hashtag #rstudioconf becomes really active leading up to and during the event. If you‚Äôre not attending the conference, following this hashtag gives you an idea of the what‚Äôs going on during the conference. Tweets often contain take home messages of talks, screenshots, or links to slides. People attending the conference often use Twitter to meet up for coffee, or to get info on sessions that are cancelled. Other event hashtags: #useR + year, eg. #useR2020 #eRum + year, eg. #eRum2020 #SatRday can't believe #rstudioconf talks are already online!! go watch me laugh at my own jokes for 20 minutes (and also learn a bit about repeated reporting) https://t.co/hfKu1vhNzp ‚Äî Sharla Gelfand (@sharlagelfand) February 6, 2020 "]
