The R community is very active on twitter. You can learn a lot about the language, about new approaches to problems, make friends and even land a job or next contract. It’s a real-time pulse of the R community. Artwork by @allison_horst Start by downloading the Twitter app or visiting the desktop site. Create an account and you’re good to go. When your first start, you’ll be prompted to follow some popular accounts. Go ahead and select a few. Don’t worry about which you select, we’ll show you how to unfollow accounts later. For now, just pick a few and continue. "],

Accounts can be owned either by individuals or admistered by companies. Twitter will often recommend accounts for you to follow. Some may be relevant, so go ahead and follow them. Over time, you’ll find that you follow more and more people. 2.1 Following people and organisations You can find people to follow by searching for their Twitter handle. This is a unique identifier associated with each account. &lt;&gt; We’ve listed a few accounts for you to follow and get some practice at the same time. These are some prominent members of the R community and they post good stuff. Go ahead and search for these accounts and follow them. Let’s walk you through the first one. Search for Hadley Wickham by typing @hadleywickham in the search bar. Hadley’s profile will come up and you can select the follow button. Well done! You’ve followed your first person :). Now go ahead and follow a few other people: Mara Averick: @dataandme Caitlin Hudon: @beeonaposy Thomas Mock: @thomas_mock Gina Reynolds: @EvaMaeRey There are also great organisational accounts: R4DS online learning community: @R4DScommunity R-Ladies Global: @RLadiesGlobal If you’re like me, you may start remembering people by their Twitter handle rather than their actual name! Oh yes, you can also go ahead and follow me if you want :). Oscar Baruffa: @oscar_b123 Now that you’re following people your feed will be populated by what they post, what they like and re-tweet. We’ll dive a little deeper into how the feed works a little later. But first: 2.1.1 A note on your own follower count I can’t stress this enough. &gt; Ignore your own follower count. It’s a great boost to ego as your follower number grows, but the benefit you get comes from following other accounts. You may get some followers yourself but that has no bearing on how much value you’ll get from using Twitter. 2.2 How to unfollow people When you first signed up to Twitter, you were prompted to follow some popular accounts and you can now practice unfollowing on these. First let’s go back to those accounts you followed earlier. Your accounts will be different from these but the steps remain the same. &lt;show unfollow steps, select profile, select followed accoutns, unfollwo uccoonuts&gt;&gt; You can also unfollow directly from your feed lithis this. Well done! You’re already getting the hang of this. Let’s have a closer look at how your Twitter feed works. "],
["read-the-feed.html", "3 Read the feed", " 3 Read the feed So know you’re following some folks. Let’s look at your feed. &lt;&gt; From time to time Twitter modifies the algorithms for what shows up in your feed, but here are the main things that causes a Tweet to enter it. Bear with us here! Someone you follow posts a tweet. &lt; Someone you follow re-posts a tweet from someone else a.ka. posts a retweet a.k.a retweets. The retweet can either be with or without their own comment above it. &lt;&gt; &lt;&gt; Someone you follow likes someone else’s tweet. That liked-tweet will be displayed in your feed. Someone you follow replies to a tweet. Often just their reply will show in your feed, but if a lot of people you follow reply to a tweet, the the orginal tweet also appaers with the thread of replies below it. &gt; Posts from account that you don’t follow but is followed by a lot of the people who you follow and that post is gettign a lot of interaction either from likes, retweets or comments. Advertisments. These have a little “promoted” tweet indicator. &lt;show promoted There’s also two ways that you feed gets ordered. Either migically or chronologially. Soem people have a preference, others don’t. There’s the “magic” way which is probably the default setting. This tries to prioritise posts that you might like, regardless of chronological order. If like me you prefer more chronological posts, turn this off like this. &gt; "],
