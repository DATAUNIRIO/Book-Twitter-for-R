The R community is very active on twitter. You can learn a lot about the language, about new approaches to problems, make friends and even land a job or next contract. It‚Äôs a real-time pulse of the R community. Artwork by @allison_horst Start by downloading the Twitter app or visiting the desktop site. Create an account and you‚Äôre good to go. When your first start, you‚Äôll be prompted to follow some popular accounts. Go ahead and select a few. Don‚Äôt worry about which you select, we‚Äôll show you how to unfollow accounts later. For now, just pick a few and continue. "],
["follow-some-folks.html", "2 Follow some folks 2.1 Following people and organisations 2.2 How to unfollow people", " 2 Follow some folks The key to making Twitter work for you is to follow accounts that you find interesting. Accounts can be owned either by individuals or admistered by companies. Twitter will often recommend accounts for you to follow. Some may be relevant, so go ahead and follow them. Over time, you‚Äôll find that you follow more and more accounts. 2.1 Following people and organisations You can find people to follow by searching for their Twitter handle. This is a unique identifier associated with each account. For example, Allison Horst‚Äôs tag is ‚Äú@allison_horst‚Äù. Comparing scenarios &amp; connecting sample differences to p-values to evidence for population differences. pic.twitter.com/9qrHVoDS76 ‚Äî Allison Horst (@allison_horst) January 12, 2020 Tags are the basis for interacting with other accounts on twitter. When you want to mention someone in a tweet, a tag is how you‚Äôll do it. We‚Äôll do some practice tweeting soon! We‚Äôve listed a few accounts for you to follow and get some practice at the same time. These are some prominent members of the R community and they post good stuff. Go ahead and search for these accounts and follow them. Let‚Äôs walk you through the first one. Select the search bar (the magnifying glass icon üîç ) Search for Hadley Wickham by typing @hadleywickham in the search bar. Hadley‚Äôs profile will come up. Select it. Select the follow button. Well done! You‚Äôve followed your first person :). Now go ahead and follow a few other prominent R-people: Mara Averick: @dataandme Caitlin Hudon: @beeonaposy Thomas Mock: @thomas_mock Gina Reynolds: @EvaMaeRey Jenny Bryan: @JennyBryan There are also great organisational accounts: R4DS online learning community: @R4DScommunity R-Ladies Global: @RLadiesGlobal You may start remembering people by their Twitter handle rather than their actual name! Oh yes, you can also go ahead and follow Oscar and Veerle if you‚Äôd like to :). Oscar Baruffa: @oscarbaruffa Veerle van Son: @veerlevanson Now that you‚Äôre following people your feed will be populated by what they post, what they like and re-tweet. We‚Äôll dive a little deeper into how the feed works a little later. But first: 2.1.1 A note on your own follower count This can‚Äôt be stressed enough. Ignore your own follower count. It‚Äôs a great boost to ego as your follower number grows, but the benefit you get comes from following other accounts, not who follows you. Crosses fingers, hopes that Hadley follows You may get some followers yourself but that has no bearing on how much value you‚Äôll get from using Twitter. 2.2 How to unfollow people When you first signed up to Twitter, you were prompted to follow some popular accounts and you can now practice unfollowing on these. First let‚Äôs go back to those accounts you followed earlier. Your accounts will be different from these but the steps remain the same. Select your own profile photo on the top left of the screen, this opens your menu. Tap on the ‚Äú6 Following‚Äù number, your number might be different to this. You can unfollow accounts by tapping on the ‚ÄúFollowing‚Äù button. You can also unfollow directly from your feed like this. On any tweet by the account you wish to unfollow, tap the little drop-down arrow to the right of their accout name. Select Unfollow. Well done! You‚Äôre already getting the hang of this. Let‚Äôs have a closer look at how your Twitter feed works. "],

Let‚Äôs look at your feed. From time to time Twitter modifies the algorithms for what shows up in your feed. Here are the main ways your feed is populated. P.S. Bear with us here! 3.1 Someone you follow posts a tweet This is the basic way your feed works. Soemone you follow posts a tweet, it shows up in you feed. 3.2 Someone you follow replies to a tweet. A reply-tweet from someone you follow will show up in your feed. If you follow both the original poster of the tweet, you‚Äôll see the both the reply, and the orginal tweet being replied to. If a lot of people that you follow reply to a tweet, the the orginal tweet may appear with the thread of replies below it, even if you don‚Äôt follow that orginal account that made the tweet. In the example below, Alison posted a tweet and Sil replied to it, and I follow both of them. ## Retweets Someone you follow re-posts a tweet from someone else a.ka. posts a retweet a.k.a retweets. The retweet can either be with or without their own comment above it. Both options are provided to you when you wish to rewteet Here you can see Zoe retweet this tweet (without commenting) from Programming Wisdom. Here we see Bob retweeted a tweet by Malcolm, and commented on it. 3.3 Liked tweets Someone you follow likes someone else‚Äôs tweet. That liked-tweet will be displayed in your feed, even if you don‚Äôt follwo the account of the person whose tweet was Liked. This tweet showed in my feed because Chelsea liked a tweet from Eli 3.4 High enagagement tweets A tweet that is gettign a lot of comments, liek and enagements from the people you follow might show up in your feed, even if you don‚Äôt follow that account yourself. 3.5 Promoted tweets Advertisments. These have a little ‚Äúpromoted‚Äù tweet indicator. It is posisble for anyone to promote their tweets by paying money, but that‚Äôs not necessary for you to be concerned with. "],

By now hashtags have found their way across multiple social media platforms. Selecting any hashtag you see will take you to a list of tweets that feature that tag. Some important ones for your R journey are: 4.1 #RStats As a hashtag consisting of just one letter (#R) didn‚Äôt quite cut it, the hashtag that was settled on was #rstats. It is probably the most widely used hashtag by the R twitter community. The hashtag was first used in 2009. RT @ChrisAlbon @drewconway #rstats is the official R statistical language hashtag. #rstats (because #R doesn't cut it) ‚Äî Michael E. Driscoll (@medriscoll) April 3, 2009 I declare #rstats the official R statistical prog lang hashtag, pass it on to friends, family and Stata users ‚Äî Drew Conway (@drewconway) April 3, 2009 4.2 #TidyTuesday Every week there is a Tidy Tuesday challenge posted. It‚Äôs a dataset that everyone makes visualisations about and shares their results (and often source code too!). This is a fun way to improve your own skills by learning how others do things and practicing on interesting datasets. The @R4DScommunity welcomes you to week 7 of #TidyTuesday! We're exploring Hotel Bookings and tidy time-series with {tsibble}!üìÅ https://t.co/sElb4fcv3uüì∞ https://t.co/aaRUiVwpku#r4ds #tidyverse #rstats #dataviz pic.twitter.com/QG8QpzCugr ‚Äî Tom Mock (@thomas_mock) February 10, 2020 4.3 Event hashtags One of the best aspects of Twitter is following news about events and conferences. Of of the most popular is RstudioConf. The hashtag #rstudioconf becomes really active leading up to and during the event. If you‚Äôre not attending the conference, following this hashtag gives you an idea of the what‚Äôs going on during the conference. Tweets often contain take home messages of talks, screenshots, or links to slides. People attending the conference often use Twitter to meet up for coffee, or to get info on sessions that are cancelled. Other event hashtags: #useR + year, eg. #useR2020 #eRum + year, eg. #eRum2020 #SatRday can't believe #rstudioconf talks are already online!! go watch me laugh at my own jokes for 20 minutes (and also learn a bit about repeated reporting) https://t.co/hfKu1vhNzp ‚Äî Sharla Gelfand (@sharlagelfand) February 6, 2020 "],
["your-first-tweets.html", "5 Your first tweets", " 5 Your first tweets Enough of the tour, let‚Äôs get you tweeting! Select the compose tweet button and start typing - note that Pyou can‚Äôt edit a tweet once it‚Äôs posted*. Don‚Äôt worry, everyone has forgiven spellign msiatkes in tweets long ago :). Say anythign you want, or if you‚Äôre stuck for inspiration say ‚ÄúYay! My first tweet!‚Äù, or the ever famous, ‚ÄúHello, world!‚Äù. Now try another tweet, this time tagging people. Say something like ‚ÄúHey @veerlevanson @oscarb I‚Äôm trying this twitter thing out.‚Äù We‚Äôll both get notifications of your tweet, and are eagerly waiting for it ;). Now try use a hashtag. ‚ÄúWow #rstats is awesome!‚Äù Now people browsing this hashtag are more likely to see your tweet. You‚Äôll get the hang of this in no-time. We‚Äôll dissect some tweets later, but you get the idea. Just a little tip, limit the use of hashtags to 3 or less in a tweet to keep it legible. Using camel case (#ThisIsCamelCase) makes hashtags more readable, and ensures screen readers pronounce the hashtag as separate words. &lt;Allison Horst‚Äôs image on cases?&gt; Make sure you capitalize the first letter of each word in hashtags so that screen reader software reads out each word separately. It also makes them #EasierToRead! https://t.co/ydkRk8eRw0 ‚Äî RNIB (@RNIB) March 21, 2018 "],

Be comfortable with unfollowing people - be a bit ruthless even. Block people easily - there‚Äôs no need for idiots to fill up your feed! 8.1 Mute words This is a really handy feature. Specifying mute words keeps any tweets with those mostly out of your feed. When people quote tweet then the mute doesn‚Äôt pick those up. Oscar‚Äôs current mute list as of 31 January 2020 * Republican * Dems * democrats * Kavanaugh * Facebook * Democrat * GOP * Kanye West This has vastly improved my experience :).
