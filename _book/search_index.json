The R community is very active on twitter. You can learn a lot about the language, about new approaches to problems, make friends and even land a job or next contract. It’s a real-time pulse of the R community. Artwork by @allison_horst Start by downloading the Twitter app or visiting the desktop site. Create an account and you’re good to go. When your first start, you’ll be prompted to follow some popular accounts. Go ahead and select a few. Don’t worry about which you select, we’ll show you how to unfollow accounts later. For now, just pick a few and continue. "]
