# All about bots

There are some accounts that may look a bit odd or behave strangely. These are generally bots. 
We'll introduce some of these to you below. 


## Benign bots
Tweets are related to things like the weather forecasts, or perhaps some mundane activity that somewhere, someone, finds useful.

This bot is tweeting the weather for Utrecht, Netherlands. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">current weather in Utrecht: few clouds, 9Â°C<br>70% humidity, wind 10kmh, pressure 1016mb</p>&mdash; Utrecht Weather (@_UtrechtNL) <a href="https://twitter.com/_UtrechtNL/status/1229813120882708481?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 18, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


## Funny bots
Tweets are usually humourous or related to some sort of activity like reply to tweets with words replaced by something humorous.
