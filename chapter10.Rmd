# Twitter oddities 

There are some accounts that may look a bit odd or behave strangely. 
We'll introduce some of these to you now:

NOTE: need examples of each

## Bot accounts
Humans to do not actively tweet from bot accounts - they are set up to do so automatically.


### Benign bots
Tweets are related to things like the weather forecasts, or perhaps some mundane activity that somewhere, someone, finds useful.


### Funny bots
Tweets are usally humourous or related to some sort of activity like reply to tweets with words replaced by something humorous. 


### Malicious bots
Could be some sort of automated scripts posing as humans, usually designed to invoke nager by commenting rudely about some political topic and often replies to popular accounts. 
The idea is that human followers see this and are influenced by them. 
You can spot these usually because you can't believe a real person would have such an account - off image, weird auto--generated username, very few followers, very few tweets. 
Twitter's algorithms are getting much better at shutting these accounts down than in the past. 

### Trolls
Just your regular real world human troll. Block them. 

### Dead accounts
You might find you want to follow your favourite band or some person who hasn't tweeted in ages, or never tweeted. This happens and these accounts are sometimes created to be able to claim the Twitter tag which may have some significance to the owner. Or the owner doesn't use the account anymore, but never bothered to delete it.
