# Cultivating your magic garden - tips for a great experience

I view Twitter like a garden that needs to be cultivated.

Be comfortable with unfollowing people - be a bit ruthelss even.

Block with abandon.

## Mute words

This is a really handy feature. Specifyign mute words keeps any tweets with those _mostly_ out of yoru feed. When people quote tweet then the mute doesn't pick those up.

My current mute list as of 1 September 2019
* Republican
* Dems
* democrats
* Kavanaugh
* Facebook
* Democrat
* GOP
* Kanye West

This has vastly improved my experience :).


You don't need to listen to everyone's views. This can be your happy place online. You don't need permission to make it so.
