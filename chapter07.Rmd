- Scheduling tweets
Instead of sending your tweet into the world right away, you can schedule it to be sent out at a specific date and time. Maybe your tweet is about a specific event, and you only want your tweet to appear when the event has started. First, write your tweet like you would normally do. To schedule, click the calendar / clock icon and choose date and time. The **Tweet** button is now a **Schedule** button. Click the button and you're done! Under the calendar / clock icon, you can also select the **Scheduled tweets** at the bottom to see a list of tweets you've scheduled but that haven't been sent yet.
