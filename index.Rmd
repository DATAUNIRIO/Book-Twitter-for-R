The R community is very active on Twitter. 
You can learn a lot about the language, about new approaches to problems, make friends and even land a job or next contract. 
It's a real-time pulse of the R community.

## What you can get out of Twitter

So, you're an R-programmer. What can you gain from becoming active on Twitter?

First of all, what is Twitter exactly? It's a [microblogging and social media website](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter) that started in 2006. Messages on this platform are called tweets, and have a maximum length of 280 characters (used to be 140 characters). On Twitter, you base your decision to follow someone on whether you think their content is interesting. Unlike Facebook, Twitter is not based on who you know in real life.

### The friendly R community
The online R community is known as a friendly bunch! Some even say it's the greatest benefit of using R. 
It's OK to ask questions, people support each other and are genuinly happy for each other if there is good news to share. 
Connecting to the online #rstats Twitter community can be especially useful if you're the only one using R in your company or institution.

### Keeping up with what's going down
Twitter is a great source for news. It allows you to keep up with the release of new packages, job opportunities and conferences.  
Lots of people in the R community have blogs, and they will tweet about it if they published a new blog post. 


But it's not all so serious, there is also room for some lighter content. Joking about the things we all struggle with as R programmers strengthens the sense of community.

### Encouragement
Everybody struggles sometimes, and that's OK. 
Support network

### Making friends on Twitter (it's a real thing)

Maybe it's hard to picture if you haven't used Twitter before, but it's a place where you can actually make a real connection with other people. Sometimes you get to meet the friends you made on Twitter in real life, eg. at a conference. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Person at an event: oh hi, I know you from twitter<br>Me: ...sorry remind me?<br>Person: *says his name, full job title, things we talked about*<br>Me: ...er...?<br>Person: my profile picture is a banana?<br>Me: Banana!!! How are you?! So great to meet in real life!</p>&mdash; Robyn Vinter (@RobynVinter) <a href="https://twitter.com/RobynVinter/status/1225839669201469445?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 7, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 


Now you know what Twitter can bring you as an R programmer, we'll move on to making a Twitter account and find the first people to follow.
