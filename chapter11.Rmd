# Diving deeper into R and Twitter

Now that you've got the hang of Twitter - here are some more advanced things you can do. 

## Curating the R-ladies account


## Scheduling tweets
Instead of sending your tweet into the world right away, you can schedule it to be sent out at a specific date and time. Maybe your tweet is about a specific event, and you only want your tweet to appear when the event has started. First, write your tweet like you would normally do. To schedule, click the calendar / clock icon and choose date and time. The **Tweet** button is now a **Schedule** button. Click the button and you're done! Under the calendar / clock icon, you can also select the **Scheduled tweets** at the bottom to see a list of tweets you've scheduled but that haven't been sent yet.

Note: This feature hasn't been rolled out to all accounts yet. 


## Analyzing Twitter data with rtweets
Twitter is a great source of data for all sorts of analyses. You can use the excellent [rtweet](https://rtweet.info/index.html){target="_blank"} package to access the data. 



## Sending tweets from inside Rstudio (rtweets / tweetRcode)

Oh yes, you send send tweets directly from Rstuio, also using [rtweet](https://rtweet.info/index.html){target="_blank"}
