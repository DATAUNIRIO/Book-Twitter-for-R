# Cultivating your magic garden - tips for a great experience

We advise you treat Twitter like a garden that needs to be cultivated. 

Be comfortable with unfollowing people - be a bit ruthless even.

Block people easily - there's no need for idiots to fill up your feed! 

## Mute words

This is a really handy feature. Specifying mute words keeps any tweets with those _mostly_ out of your feed. When people quote tweet then the mute doesn't pick those up.

* democrats
* Kavanaugh
* Facebook
* Democrat
* GOP
* Kanye West

This has vastly improved my experience :).


You don't need to listen to everyone's views. This can be your happy place online. You don't need permission to make it so.
