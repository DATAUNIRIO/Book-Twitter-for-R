From time to time Twitter modifies the algorithms for what shows up in your feed. Here are the main ways your feed is populated. 

P.S. Bear with us here! 

## Someone you follow posts a tweet

This is the basic way your feed works. Soemone you follow posts a tweet, it shows up in you feed. 


## Someone you follow replies to a tweet. 

A reply-tweet from someone you follow will show up in your feed. If you follow both the original poster of the tweet, you'll see the both the reply, and the orginal tweet being replied to. 

If a lot of people that you follow reply to a tweet, the the orginal tweet may appear with the thread of replies below it, even if you don't follow that orginal account that made the tweet.

In the example below, Alison posted a tweet and Sil replied to it, and I follow both of them.
