# Read the feed

So know you're following some folks. Let's look at your feed.

From time to time Twitter modifies the algorithms for what shows up in your feed, but here are the main things that causes a Tweet to enter it. 

Bear with us here!

1. Someone you follow posts a tweet.

<<posted tweet>
    
* Someone you follow re-posts a tweet from someone else a.ka. posts a retweet a.k.a retweets. The retweet can either be with or without their own comment above it. 

<<retweet without comment>>
<<retweet with comment>>

* Someone you follow likes someone else's tweet. That liked-tweet will be displayed in your feed. 

<liekd tweet>

* Someone you follow replies to a tweet. Often just their reply will show in your feed, but if a lot of people you follow reply to a tweet, the the orginal tweet also appaers with the thread of replies below it.

<reply to tweet>>

* Posts from account that you don't follow but is followed by a lot of the people who you follow and that post is gettign a lot of interaction either from likes, retweets or comments.

* Advertisments. These have a little "promoted" tweet indicator.

There's also two ways that you feed gets ordered. Either migically or chronologially.  
Soem people have a preference, others don't. 

There's the "magic" way which is probably the default setting. 
This tries to prioritise posts that you might like, regardless of chronological order. 
If like me you prefer more chronological posts, turn this off like this.
