## Notes for contributors

The aim of this book is to give people a basic introduction to Twitter. 

The intended audience is specifically R programmers.

Avoid the temptation to go into a lot of detail, backgroudn information or show multipel ways to do things. 

We can assume the reader is not completely new to social media and can figure things out. 

At the time of writing this, 2019-09-25, the book is still written very much from my (Oscar's) perspective  -  amend from "I" to "we".

It's good to be opinionated on what you think it is good/bad/best to do, but lets keep it directed towards positive action e.g. "do this" is preferences "don't do that".

## Version control

I am busy learning the basics of github. I suggest you keep Pull Requests short at first so that I can figure out how to merge them. I may end up accidently deleting somethign so rather don't do a whole lot of work before putting in the first PR. 

Try write once sentence per line in the rmarkdown files - apparently this makes version cotnrol a bit easier.
